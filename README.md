# ASP.NET Core Practice - Inventory System Day 1
## Introduction
This practice is meant to challenge your mastery of ASP.NET and how well you are able to use ASP.NET Web API to create a CRUD application. Your goal in this practice is to create an inventory management system which helps a company keep track of goods and supplies. As goods and supplies are restocked, sold, or used, your application should update the data appropriately to reflect the changes. This is a cumulative activity. You will build on this practice for your next assignment.
